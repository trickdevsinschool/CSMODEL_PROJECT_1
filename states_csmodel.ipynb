    "This notebook serves as a analysis of the [U.S. Education Datasets: Unification Project](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project) found in Kaggle. This serves as our submission for the requirements of our class CSMODEL SY 2020-2021 Term 3. \n",

    "The U.S Education Dataset: Unification Project is an effort by Roy Garrard to reflect the \"multiple facets\" of the US education system in one csv file. He aggregated the data collected from various source, mainly from the  U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). It contains data of the number of students enrolled in a year, in each grade level, separated in each states. The data spans from 1992 to the last update of 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **NAEP** stands for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), [which is an assessment of the educational system in the US](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/). It is an exam taken by students in Grade 4, 8, and 12 [every two years](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/ltt_main_diff.asp). The scale of scores in Grades 4 and 8 is from 0-500 while the scale of scores in Grade 12 is 0-300. There are lots of subjects like Science and Geography and it is mostly added in the Grade 12 exams, but what they all have in common and most important data to check are the **Reading and Math scores**. This is the source of the academic grades columns from Roy \n"

    "From the line plot we can see that compared to older years the latest scores or the scores for 2019 are lower compared to previous years but there was an increase in the two years after 2011 but starting from 2017 the decline happened. Comparing the two graphs we can see that we have two different years in which a subject reached it peak, for math it was the year 2013 and for reading it was 2015 but the lowest is only 2019."

    "For the second EDA, we would like to see the statistics involved during the 2019 NAEP exam. We have two sets of numbers to work with, grade 4 reading results and grade 4 math results. The first thing to do is to drop one row which is the NATIONAL row. The original dataset author included this to show the mean for the scores in the USA during 2019, since we would like to figure this out on our own, and at the same time visualize it, we're dropping it for now."
