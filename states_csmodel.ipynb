    "The U.S Education Dataset: Unification Project is an effort by Roy Garrard to reflect the \"multiple facets\" of the US education system in one csv file. He aggregated the data collected from various source, mainly from the  U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). It contains data of the number of students enrolled in a year, in each grade level, separated in each states. The data spans from 1992 to the last update of 2019. \n"

The states_all.csv is an aggregated version of the data found in states_all_extended, to look at the bigger picture ourselves, we will be looking into the second file: **states_all_extended.csv** only.\n",
