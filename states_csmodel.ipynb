    "The U.S Education Dataset: Unification Project is an effort by Roy Garrard to reflect the \"multiple facets\" of the US education system in one csv file. He aggregated the data collected from various source, mainly from the  U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). It contains data of the number of students enrolled in a year, in each grade level, separated in each states. The data spans from 1992 to the last update of 2019. \n"

    "The collection of data were gathered by the use of different online sources that have databases on the number of enrollment, financials and academic achievement. The website gathered the data using surveys and reports from different government websites like U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics with the following links:\n",
    "- Enrollment\n",

    "\n",
    "In the Kaggle Library, there two (2) csv files: states_all.csv and states_all_extended.csv. The states_all.csv is an aggregated version of the data found in states_all_extended, to look at the bigger picture ourselves, we will be looking into the second file: **states_all_extended.csv** only.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 1715 observations inside the states_all_extended file. Each observation is a state in the U.S. together with what year the columns are from.\n",

    "Example: 1992_ALABAMA is different from 2000_ALABAMA\n",
    "\n",
    "The example given is from the column PRIMARY_KEY. This gives easier access to which state and year we would want to observe, although there are 2 columns that contain those variables (STATE, YEAR).\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns represent the data that concerns the schools of that given state in that given period of time. It is mainly concerned data such as number of student per grade level, the state revenue generated by the schools, academic performance, race, gender, etc.\n"
