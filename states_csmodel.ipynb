    "This notebook serves as a analysis of the [U.S. Education Datasets: Unification Project](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project) found in Kaggle. This serves as our submission for the requirements of our class CSMODEL SY 2020-2021 Term 3. \n",

    "The U.S Education Dataset: Unification Project is an effort by Roy Garrard to reflect the \"multiple facets\" of the US education system in one csv file. He aggregated the data collected from various source, mainly from the  U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). It contains data of the number of students enrolled in a year, in each grade level, separated in each states. The data spans from 1992 to the last update of 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **NAEP** stands for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), [which is an assessment of the educational system in the US](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/). It is an exam taken by students in Grade 4, 8, and 12 [every two years](https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/ltt_main_diff.asp). The scale of scores in Grades 4 and 8 is from 0-500 while the scale of scores in Grade 12 is 0-300. There are lots of subjects like Science and Geography and it is mostly added in the Grade 12 exams, but what they all have in common and most important data to check are the **Reading and Math scores**. This is the source of the academic grades columns from Roy \n"
